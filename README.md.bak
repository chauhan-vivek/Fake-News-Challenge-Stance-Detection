Stance detection involves identifying fake news based on other news organizations' perspectives.

This repository contains the code for a fake news detection model using GradientBoosting Classifier as a baseline and RoBerta as the final model. The goal of this challenge is to accurately classify fake news from real news using machine learning techniques.

Baseline Model
The baseline model uses a GradientBoosting Classifier to classify news articles as fake or real. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled news articles and is able to achieve an accuracy of 80% on the test set.

Final Model
After trying multiple models such as FastTextCNN, LSTM, and Attention networks, the final model uses RoBERTa, a transformer-based language model pre-trained on a large corpus of text. The RoBerta model is fine-tuned on the labeled news dataset and is able to achieve an accuracy of 92% on the test set.

Done!
